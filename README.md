## Installation

 **This Document has been created for angular FAQs and Error debugging**.



### Composer

**Note:** composer 2.1+ is required!

The latest version can be installed via composer too. This is especially useful if you want to create new TYPO3 installations automatically or play with the latest code. You need to install the composer package first if it isn't already available:

`php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php -- --filename=composer`

In order to tell install TYPO3, you have to execute

`composer create-project typo3/cms-base-distribution myshop`

This will install TYPO3 into the `./myshop/` directory.

Then, change to the `./mshop/` directory and install the Aimeos extension for TYPO3 with:

`composer req aimeos/aimeos-typo3:~21.10`

This will install stable TYPO3 version and the latest Aimeos TYPO3 extension. If you want a more or less working installation out of the box for new installations, you should install the Bootstrap package too:

`composer req bk2k/bootstrap-package`


```
'DB' => [
    'Connections' => [
        'Default' => [
            'tableoptions' => [
                'charset' => 'utf8',
                'collate' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
            ],
            // ...
        ],
    ],
],
```



#### TYPO3 11

When using TYPO3 11, you have to run these commands from your installation directory:

```bash
php ./vendor/bin/typo3 extension:setup
php ./vendor/bin/typo3 aimeos:setup --option=setup/default/demo:1
```

If you don't want to add the Aimeos demo data, you should remove `--option=setup/default/demo:1` from the Aimeos setup command.



### TER Extension

## Page setup

The page setup for an Aimeos web shop is easy if you import the example page tree for TYPO3 10/11:

* [21.10+ page tree](https://aimeos.org/fileadmin/download/Aimeos-pages_21.10.t3d) only

**Note:** The Aimeos layout expects [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) providing the grid layout!
